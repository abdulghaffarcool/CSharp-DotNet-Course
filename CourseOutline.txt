THIS IS A COURSE FOR ABSOLUTE BEGINNERS AND I WILL BE EMPHASIZING ON THE BASICS 
AND WON'T BE COVERING ADVANCED CONCEPTS.
IF YOU ARE NOT A BEGINNER THEN EITHER WAIT FOR OUR "C# COURSE FOR PROS" OR JOIN THIS COURSE FROM LESSON 6.

********************
Lesson-1
********************

C# Intro
	It is an object-oriented programming language created by Microsoft that runs on the .NET Framework.
	C# has roots from the C family, and the language is close to other popular languages like C++ and Java.
	The first version was released in year 2002. The latest version, C# 11, was released in November 2022.

C# is used to develop:
	Mobile applications
	Desktop applications
	Web applications
	Web services
	Web sites
	Games
	VR
	Database applications
	And much, much more!

Why Use C#?
	It is one of the most popular programming language in the world
	It is easy to learn and simple to use
	It has a huge community support
	C# is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs
	As C# is close to C, C++ and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C# or vice versa

C# IDE
	The easiest way to get started with C#, is to use an IDE.
	An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is used to edit and compile code.
	In our tutorial, we will use Visual Studio Community, which is free to download from 
	https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/.
	Applications written in C# use the .NET Framework, so it makes sense to use Visual Studio, as the program, 
	the framework, and the language, are all created by Microsoft.

C# Syntax
	C# is a case sensitive language i.e. country and Country are two different things.
	; is used as statement terminator.

C# Output
	Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
	Console.WriteLine("I am Learning C#");
	Console.WriteLine("It is awesome!");
	Console.WriteLine(3 + 3);
	Console.Write("I will print on the same line.");

C# Comments
	Single line comments // this is a comment
	Multiline comments /* This is 
						  multiline comment. */

C# Variables & Data Types
	Variables are containers for storing data values.

	In C#, there are different types of variables (defined with different keywords), for example:

	int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
	double - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
	char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
	string - stores text, such as "Hello World". String values are surrounded by double quotes
	bool - stores values with two states: true or false

	int myNum = 5;
	double myDoubleNum = 5.99D;
	char myLetter = 'D';
	bool myBool = true;
	string myText = "Hello";
	int x = 5, y = 6, z = 50;

C# User Input
	// Type your username and press enter
	Console.WriteLine("Enter username:");

	// Create a string variable and get user input from the keyboard and store it in the variable
	string userName = Console.ReadLine();

	// Print the value of the variable (userName), which will display the input value
	Console.WriteLine("Username is: " + userName);
